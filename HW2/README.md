# UP25 HW2
Due Date: 2025-06-02

## Simple Instruction Level Debugger

In this homework, you have to implement a simple instruction-level debugger that allows a user to debug a program interactively at the assembly instruction level. You should implement the debugger by using the `ptrace` interface in C, C++, 🦀 Rust, or ⚡ Zig. The commands you have to implement are detailed in the [Commands Requirements](#Commands-Requirements).

-  Your debugger must support **x86-64** binaries, including both static and dynamically linked executables, as well as **PIE** (Position-Independent Executable) enabled binaries.
-  You don't need to handle the program that might use `fork`, `vfork`, `clone`, `clone3`, `execve`, `execveat` syscalls.
- We use the [sample program](https://up.zoolab.org/unixprog/hw02/hw2_testing_program.zip) to demonstrate how to use the debugger.

### Usage

- You can load a program after/when the debugger starts. See the [load program](#Load-Program) section for the details.

- You should print "`(sdb) `" as the prompt in every line, no matter whether you have loaded the program.

```bash
# Launch the debugger directly
$ ./sdb
# Launch the debugger with a program
$ ./sdb [program]
...
```

## Commands Requirements

:::info
We will not test any error handling not mentioned in this spec. You can determine how to handle the other errors by yourself.
:::

### Load Program

- Command: `load [path to a program]`

- Load a program after the debugger starts.
    - You should output `** please load a program first.` if you input any other commands before loading a program.

- When the program is loaded:
    - The debugger should print the **name of the executable and the entry point address**.
    - Before waiting for the user’s input, the debugger should **stop at the entry point of the target binary** and **disassemble 5 instructions** starting from the current program counter (rip).

- Sample output of `./sdb`
```
(sdb) info reg
** please load a program first.
(sdb) load ./hello
** program './hello' loaded. entry point: 0x401620.
      401620: f3 0f 1e fa                      endbr64
      401624: 31 ed                            xor       ebp, ebp
      401626: 49 89 d1                         mov       r9, rdx
      401629: 5e                               pop       rsi
      40162a: 48 89 e2                         mov       rdx, rsp
```
- Sample output of `./sdb ./hello`
```
** program './hello' loaded. entry point: 0x401620.
      401620: f3 0f 1e fa                      endbr64
      401624: 31 ed                            xor       ebp, ebp
      401626: 49 89 d1                         mov       r9, rdx
      401629: 5e                               pop       rsi
      40162a: 48 89 e2                         mov       rdx, rsp
(sdb)
```

- Sample output of `./sdb ./hola`
```
** program './hola' loaded. entry point: 0x599402b70080.
      599402b70080: f3 0f 1e fa                      endbr64
      599402b70084: 31 ed                            xor       ebp, ebp
      599402b70086: 49 89 d1                         mov       r9, rdx
      599402b70089: 5e                               pop       rsi
      599402b7008a: 48 89 e2                         mov       rdx, rsp
(sdb)
```

:::info
**Note:**
- For dynamic linked ELF (e.g. `hola`), you need to stop on the entry point of the **target binary**, not the dynamic linker's entry point. (You can set a breakpoint at the entrypoint after first stop, and continue the execution.)
- Due to `hola` also has PIE enabled, the address will differ each time you run the program, but the instructions you got should remain the same.
- You can verify the entry point offset by running:
      `readelf -h ./hola | grep Entry`
    - If `readelf` is not available, install the `binutils` package for your Linux distribution first.
    - For your convenience, the offset of the entry point of `hola` is `0x1080`
:::

### Disassemble

When returning from execution, the debugger should disassemble 5 instructions starting from the current program counter (instruction pointer). The address of the 5 instructions should be within the range of the executable region. We do not care about the format, but in each line, there should be:

1. address, e.g. `401005`
2. raw instructions in a grouping of 1 byte, e.g., `48 89 e5`
3. mnemonic, e.g., `mov`
4. operands of the instruction, e.g., `edx, 0xe`

And make sure that
- The output is aligned with the columns.
- If the disassembled instructions are less than 5 because current program counter is near the boundary of executable region or not in the executable region, output `** the address is out of the range of the executable region.`

Sample output (assume only addresses from `0x401000` to `0x402000` are executable):
```
(sdb) si
      401026: e8 10 00 00 00                    call      0x40103b
      40102b: b8 01 00 00 00                    mov       eax, 1
      401030: 0f 05                             syscall
      401032: c3                                ret
      401033: b8 00 00 00 00                    mov       eax, 0
(sdb) ...
...
(sdb) si
      401ffe: 0f 05                             syscall
** the address is out of the range of the executable region.
```

:::info
**Note:**
- You should only disassemble the program when the program is loaded or when using `si`, `cont` and `syscall` commands.
- If the `break` command **sets a breakpoint** using patched instructions like `0xcc` (int3), it should not appear in the output.
- If the `patch` command is used in the executable region, the disassembled code should be the patched value, see the [patch](#Patch-Memory) section for examples.
:::

:::info
**Hint:** You can link against the `capstone` library for disassembling.
:::

### Step Instruction

- Command: `si`

- Execute a single instruction.
    - If the program hits a breakpoint, output `** hit a breakpoint at [addr].`
    - If the program terminates, output `** the target program terminated.`

- Sample output (assume only addresses from `0x401000` to `0x402000` are executable):
```
(sdb) break 401629
** set a breakpoint at 0x401629.
(sdb) si
** hit a breakpoint at 0x401629.
      401629: 5e                               pop       rsi
      40162a: 48 89 e2                         mov       rdx, rsp
      40162d: 48 83 e4 f0                      and       rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0
      401631: 50                               push      rax
      401632: 54                               push      rsp
(sdb) si
      40162a: 48 89 e2                         mov       rdx, rsp
      40162d: 48 83 e4 f0                      and       rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0
      401631: 50                               push      rax
      401632: 54                               push      rsp
      401633: 45 31 c0                         xor       r8d, r8d
(sdb) ...
...
(sdb) si
      401ffe: 0f 05                             syscall
** the address is out of the range of the executable region.
(sdb) si
** the target program terminated.
```

### Continue

- Command: `cont`

- Continue the execution of the target program. The program should keep running until it terminates or hits a breakpoint.
    - If the program hits a breakpoint, output `** hit a breakpoint at [addr].`
    - If the program terminates, output `** the target program terminated.`

- Sample output:
```
(sdb) break 0x40100d
** set a breakpoint at 0x40100d.
(sdb) cont
** hit a breakpoint at 0x40100d.
      40100d: 48 8d 05 ec 0f 00 00              lea       rax, [rip + 0xfec]
      401014: 48 89 c6                          mov       rsi, rax
      401017: bf 01 00 00 00                    mov       edi, 1
      40101c: e8 0a 00 00 00                    call      0x40102b
      401021: bf 00 00 00 00                    mov       edi, 0
(sdb) cont
hello world!
** the target program terminated.
```

:::info
**Note:** If your implementation of `cont` requires the use of `PTRACE_SINGLE_STEP` and `int3`, you can only utilize a maximum of **two ptrace (PTRACE_SINGLE_STEP) and two int3** in the implementation of `cont`, or you will receive 0 points.
:::

### Info Registers

- Command: `info reg`

- Show all the registers and their corresponding values in hex.
    - You should output 3 registers in each line.
    - Values should be printed in 64-bit hex format.
    - **Note:** The output of `$rbp` and `$rsp` can be different.

- Sample output:
```
(sdb) info reg
$rax 0x0000000000000001    $rbx 0x0000000000000000    $rcx 0x0000000000000000
$rdx 0x000000000000000e    $rsi 0x0000000000402000    $rdi 0x0000000000000001
$rbp 0x00007ffdc479ab68    $rsp 0x00007ffdc479ab60    $r8  0x0000000000000000
$r9  0x0000000000000000    $r10 0x0000000000000000    $r11 0x0000000000000000
$r12 0x0000000000000000    $r13 0x0000000000000000    $r14 0x0000000000000000
$r15 0x0000000000000000    $rip 0x0000000000401030    $eflags 0x0000000000000202
```

### Breakpoint

#### Break at address

- Command: `break [hex address]`

- Set up a break point at the specified address. The target program should stop before the instruction at the specified address is executed. If the user resumes the program with `si` , `cont` or `syscall`, the program should not stop at the same breakpoint twice.
    - On success, output `** set a breakpoint at [hex address].`
    - On failure, output `** the target address is not valid.`
- Your debugger should accept both formats of `[hex address]`, with or without the `0x` prefix.
    - Same as other requirement.


- Sample output:
```
(sdb) break 0x401005
** set a breakpoint at 0x401005.
(sdb) break 40100d
** set a breakpoint at 0x40100d.
(sdb) si
** hit a breakpoint at 0x401005.
      401005: 48 89 e5                          mov       rbp, rsp
      401008: ba 0e 00 00 00                    mov       edx, 0xe
      40100d: 48 8d 05 ec 0f 00 00              lea       rax, [rip + 0xfec]
      401014: 48 89 c6                          mov       rsi, rax
      401017: bf 01 00 00 00                    mov       edi, 1
(sdb) si
      401008: ba 0e 00 00 00                    mov       edx, 0xe
      40100d: 48 8d 05 ec 0f 00 00              lea       rax, [rip + 0xfec]
      401014: 48 89 c6                          mov       rsi, rax
      401017: bf 01 00 00 00                    mov       edi, 1
      40101c: e8 0a 00 00 00                    call      0x40102b
```
:::info
**Note:** If you set a breakpoint at the address that current `$rip` points to, you should just go on next address after typing `si`, `cont` or `syscall` and **do not** output `** hit a breakpoint at [hex address].`
This means that the program will not stop at the address that current `$rip` points to if you set a breakpoint on it.
:::

#### Break at **Offset of Target Binary**

- Command: `breakrva [hex offset]`

- Sets a breakpoint relative to the **base address** of the target binary by the given offset, which is useful for the PIE-enabled binary.
    - On success, output `** set a breakpoint at [hex address].`
        - Note: `[hex address]` should be `base_address + offset`
    - On failure, output `** the target address is not valid.`

```
** program './hola' loaded. entry point: 0x60e3bc932080.
      60e3bc932080: f3 0f 1e fa                      endbr64
      60e3bc932084: 31 ed                            xor       ebp, ebp
      60e3bc932086: 49 89 d1                         mov       r9, rdx
      60e3bc932089: 5e                               pop       rsi
      60e3bc93208a: 48 89 e2                         mov       rdx, rsp
(sdb) breakrva 11C3
** set a breakpoint at 0x60e3bc9321c3.
(sdb) cont
** hit a breakpoint at 0x60e3bc9321c3.
      60e3bc9321c3: f3 0f 1e fa                      endbr64
      60e3bc9321c7: 55                               push      rbp
      60e3bc9321c8: 48 89 e5                         mov       rbp, rsp
      60e3bc9321cb: 48 83 ec 20                      sub       rsp, 0x20
      60e3bc9321cf: 64 48 8b 04 25 28 00 00 00       mov       rax, qword ptr fs:[0x28]
(sdb)
```

### Info Breakpoints

- Command: `info break`

- List breakpoints with index numbers (for deletion) and addresses.
    - The index of the breakpoints starts from `0`.
    - If no breakpoints, output `** no breakpoints.`
    - If a breakpoint is deleted, the index of the other breakpoints should remain the same.
    - **Note:** Also, if you add a new breakpoint, continue the indexing instead of filling the deleted index.

- Sample output:

```
(sdb) info break
** no breakpoints.
(sdb) break 0x4000ba
** set a breakpoint at 0x4000ba.
(sdb) break 0x4000bf
** set a breakpoint at 0x4000bf.
(sdb) info break
Num     Address
0       0x4000ba
1       0x4000bf
(sdb) delete 0
** delete breakpoint 0.
(sdb) info break
Num     Address
1       0x4000bf
(sdb) break 0x4000ba
** set a breakpoint at 0x4000ba.
(sdb) info break
Num     Address
1       0x4000bf
2       0x4000ba
```

### Delete Breakpoints

- Command: `delete [id]`

- Remove a break point with the specified id. The id is corresponding to the index number in [Info Breakpoints](#Info-Breakpoints).
    - On success, output `** delete breakpoint [id].`
    - If the breakpoint id does not exist, output `** breakpoint [id] does not exist.`

- Sample output:
```
(sdb) break 0x4000ba
** set a breakpoint at 0x4000ba.
(sdb) info break
Num     Address
0       0x4000ba
(sdb) delete 0
** delete breakpoint 0.
(sdb) delete 0
** breakpoint 0 does not exist.
```

### Patch Memory

- Command: `patch [hex address] [hex string]`

- Patch memory starts at the `address` with the `[hex string]`. The maximum of the `strlen([hex string])` is `2048`, and you don't need to handle the case that `strlen([hex string]) % 2 != 0` (which means that we will not given input like `a`, `aab` or `aabbc`)
    - If the patch address and the size of the hex string is valid, output `** patch memory at address [hex address].`
    - If `[hex address]` is not a valid address or `[hex address] + sizeof([hex string])` is not a valid address, output `** the target address is not valid.`.

:::info
**Note:**
-  If you patch on an instruction that has been set as a breakpoint, the breakpoint should still exist, but the original instruction should be patched.
:::
    
- Sample output:
```
(sdb) si
      401017: bf 01 00 00 00                    mov       edi, 1
      40101c: e8 0a 00 00 00                    call      0x40102b
      401021: bf 00 00 00 00                    mov       edi, 0
      401026: e8 10 00 00 00                    call      0x40103b
      40102b: b8 01 00 00 00                    mov       eax, 1
(sdb) patch 0x40101c 9000
** patch memory at 0x40101c.
(sdb) si
      40101c: 90                                nop
      40101d: 00 00                             add       byte ptr [rax], al
      40101f: 00 00                             add       byte ptr [rax], al
      401021: bf 00 00 00 00                    mov       edi, 0
      401026: e8 10 00 00 00                    call      0x40103b
(sdb) 
```

### System Call

- Command: `syscall`

- The program execution should break at every system call instruction **unless it hits a breakpoint**.
    - If it hits a breakpoint, output `** hit a breakpoint at [hex address].`
    - If it enters a syscall, output `** enter a syscall([nr]) at [hex address].`
    - If it leaves a syscall, output `** leave a syscall([nr]) = [ret] at [hex address].`

:::info
**Note:** You can ignore the cases where a breakpoint is set on a syscall instruction.
:::

- Sample output:
```
(sdb) syscall
** hit a breakpoint at 0x401008
      401008: ba 0e 00 00 00                  	mov       edx, 0xe
      40100d: 48 8d 05 ec 0f 00 00            	lea       rax, [rip + 0xfec]

:::info
**Note:**
- The output of the addresses should be different, just make sure the offset of the entrypoint and the instructions are the same.
- We used [`patchelf`](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf) to link `hola` with `libc.so.6` and `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` located in the same directory. Therefore, you need to `cd` into the directory containing `hola` to run the program properly.
    - For example: `(cd ./hw2_testing_program; ../sdb ./hola)`
