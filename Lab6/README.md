# Buffer Overflow & Shellcoding Challenges

This lab aims to practice advanced assembly tricks. Specifically, we focus on implementing buffer overflow attacks and writing shellcodes. Please read the codes and solve the challenges available on the four challenge servers.

Note that the difficulty of the challenges could be diverse. I personally recommend solving the challenges in the order.

## Challenge #1

The challenge server #1 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 12341
```

The challenge server runs your shellcode inside a seccomp sandbox where **only** the following syscalls are permitted: `open`, `openat`, `read`, `write` and `exit`. All other syscalls — including `execve`, `mmap`, `dup`, etc.—are blocked.

Your shellcode will be executed directly. Your objective is to open the file located at `/FLAG`, read its contents, and write them to `stdout` using only the allowed syscalls.


We provide the source code and the binary of the challenge server for your reference [ [source code](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab06/shellcode.c) | [binary](https://up.zoolab.org/unixprog/lab06/shellcode) ].

## Challenge #2

The challenge server #2 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 12342
```

Once connected to the challenge server, please send your shellcode in the `msg` buffer, invoke your shell code (using buffer overflow), and dump the FLAG in `/FLAG`. You may need to leak the required information from the stack to achieve the goal.

We provide the source code and the binary of the challenge server for your reference [ [source code](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab06/bof1.c) | [binary](https://up.zoolab.org/unixprog/lab06/bof1) ].

The challenge has an obvious buffer overflow problem in its implementation. Also, note that there is ***no canary*** protection for the vulnerable function.

:::danger
The reports from `checksec` may report having ***canaries*** in the executable, but don't worry about that.
:::

## Challenge #3

The challenge server #3 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 12343
```

Once connected to the challenge server, please send your shellcode in the `msg` buffer, invoke your shell code (using buffer overflow), and dump the FLAG in `/FLAG`. You may need to leak the required information from the stack to achieve the goal.

We provide the source code and the binary of the challenge server for your reference [ [source code](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab06/bof2.c) | [binary](https://up.zoolab.org/unixprog/lab06/bof2) ].

The challenge has an obvious buffer overflow problem in its implementation. <i style="color: red">The source code of bof2 is **exactly** the same as bof1.</i> The only difference is that we have ***canary protection enabled*** for the bof2 executable.

## Challenge #4

The challenge server #4 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 12344
```

Once connected to the server, your goal is to build a ROP chain to read and dump the FLAG at `/FLAG`.  You may need to leak stack information to build your chain.


We provide the source code and the binary of the challenge server for your reference [ [source code](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab06/bof3.c) | [binary](https://up.zoolab.org/unixprog/lab06/bof3) ].

Unlike previous challenges, this one does not provide a global executable buffer (`msg`). Instead of injecting and jumping to shellcode, you must build a ROP chain to achieve the same effect.

You need to know what [***returned-oriented programming (ROP)***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming) is first and then solve the challenge. More information can be found in the hint for [returned-oriented programming](#Return-Oriented-Programming).

# Hints

## How Many Bytes Are Required to Overflow a Stack?

Suppose you do not know how many bytes are required to overflow a stack. In that case, you can run the target program locally using gdb, set a **breakpoint** right before you fill the buffer (receiving user inputs), and see how far it is from the buffer address to your target address in the stack.

## Leak Stack Information

All the challenges in this lab are compiled with the `-static-pie` option, which could lead to randomly assigned runtime addresses. Therefore, you may need to leak the required information on the stack to determine the actual addresses used to load the program.

In the following example, the return address (`0x555555555649`) of the function `task` in `bof1` can be leaked from the stack. Since we have a `printf` function that dumps the buffer in `bof1`, we can simply overflow the buffer by filling 56-byte `A`s. Once the `printf` function shows the buffer's content, we can leak the actual return address of the `task` function. The leaked return address helps recover the base address of the program, and it can be further used to calculate the required address in the program.

```assembly
0c:0060│-030 0x7fffffffdd40 ◂— 0x4141414141414141 # buf1
0d:0068│-028 0x7fffffffdd48 —▸ 0x555555555583 (main) ◂— endbr64
0e:0070│-020 0x7fffffffdd50 —▸ 0x555555557d58 (__do_global_dtors_aux_fini_array_entry) —▸ 0x555555555260 (__do_global_dtors_aux) ◂— endbr64 
0f:0078│-018 0x7fffffffdd58 —▸ 0x55555555542c (sandbox+387) ◂— nop
10:0080│-010 0x7fffffffdd60 —▸ 0x555555555583 (main) ◂— endbr64
11:0088│-008 0x7fffffffdd68 —▸ 0x5555555592a0 ◂— 0x555555559
12:0090│ rbp 0x7fffffffdd70 —▸ 0x7fffffffdd80 ◂— 1
13:0098│+008 0x7fffffffdd78 —▸ 0x555555555649 (main+198) ◂— mov eax, 0
14:00a0│+010 0x7fffffffdd80 ◂— 1
15:00a8│+018 0x7fffffffdd88 —▸ 0x7ffff7d8ed90 (__libc_start_call_main+128) ◂— mov edi, eax
```

## Return-Oriented Programming

The basic idea of return-oriented programming (ROP) is to reuse pieces of executable machine instructions (often called ***gadgets***) in the memory to construct required shellcodes. This is useful when you can perform buffer overflow, but finding an executable memory area for writing shellcodes is infeasible.

You may have a look at the [page](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/return-oriented-programming/) for introducing ROP concepts. For example, suppose we plan to run the following instructions in our shellcodes:

```assembly
   mov rdi, 1
   mov rax, 60
   syscall        # exit(1)
```

You have to find ***gadgets*** that can be used to replace the involved instructions. Each gadget should be in the form of
- `pop ... ; ret`,
- `syscall`, or
- `syscall ; ret`.

Suppose you have found the instructions in the following addresses:
```assembly
0x4000025340 : pop rax , ret
0x400000918f : pop rdi , ret
0x4000022115 : syscall , ret
```
Once a `ret` instruction is to be invoked, and the stack is filled with the following content:

```
+------------------------+
| 0x400000918f <pop_rdi> |  <-- rsp is here
+------------------------+
| 0                      |
+------------------------+
| 0x4000025340 <pop_rax> |
+------------------------+
| 60                     |
+------------------------+
| 0x4000022115 <syscall> |
+------------------------+
```

Running the gadgets filled in the stack can appropriately assign the required values to `rdi` and `rax` and then invoke the `syscall` instruction.

You can use the `ROPgadget` command to find the gadget addresses in an executable. For example,

```
ROPgadget --binary bof1
```

Please note that the reported addresses are offsets to the loaded program base address because the binary is compiled with PIE-enabled. You still need to know the actual program-loaded base address to obtain the required addresses when the program is running.

In addition to the `ROPgadget` command, you may also consider the `ROP` class in the `pwntools` library. See [here](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/rop/rop.html) in the official document.

## Work with Apple Chip Computers

All the challenges in this lab require an Intel x86_64 CPU. If you are working with an Apple Chip computer, e.g., M1, M2, and M3, you can solve the challenges using the qemu user-mode emulator.

All the challenge binaries are compiled with the `-static-pie` option, making them self-contained without additional dependencies. Therefore, you can simply run the command in a ***native (aarch64-based) Linux docker*** using the command
```
qemu-x86_64-static ./bof1
```
Replace `bof1` with other challenge binaries would work. However, the base addresses used for loading a binary in qemu might be much different from those used for a native CPU. You may need to calculate the base address by yourself. It looks like, by default qemu will always use a fixed base address of `0x4000000000` for loading the text section. 

We did not check whether the ***Rosetta2*** emulator works. Please try it at your own risk.

The local runtime is only used for testing and debugging your solution. Our grading will only be based on the result of solving the challenge on the remote.

You may need to install the `gcc-multilib-x86-64-linux-gnu` package in your aarch64 Debian Linux distribution.

:::danger
All challenges in this lab make use of the `seccomp` feature to restrict system calls. However, QEMU user mode does not support `seccomp`, which means you cannot run the challenge binaries properly under QEMU, especially those involving shellcode execution.

If you are testing locally on a Mac with an Apple chip, you need to disable the seccomp sandbox to run the binaries using QEMU. This can be done by setting the `NO_SANDBOX` environment variable before execution. For example:
`NO_SANDBOX=1 qemu-x86_64-static ./shellcode`

This workaround is only intended for local testing. On the remote server, seccomp will be fully enabled, so make sure your exploit works under that constraint.
