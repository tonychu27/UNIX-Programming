# Let's Race Together

This lab aims to investigate possible race or reentrant errors from multithreaded programs. Please read the codes and solve the challenges available on the three challenge servers.

## Challenge #1

The challenge server #1 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 10931
```

Once you have connected to the challenge server, please dump the content of the `flag` file on the server.

We provide the source code of the challenge server for your reference [[view](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab05/unixfortune.c)].

## Challenge #2

The challenge server #2 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 10932
```

Once you have connected to the challenge server, please ask the challenge server to retrieve the secret from localhost:10000.

We provide the source code of the challenge server for your reference [[view](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab05/flagsrv.cpp)].

## Challenge  #3

The challenge server #3 can be accessed using the command:
```
nc up.zoolab.org 10933
```

The challenge server is a simple web server. Please read the flag from http://up.zoolab.org:10933/secret/FLAG.txt

We provide the source code of the challenge server for your reference [[view](https://up.zoolab.org/code.html?file=unixprog/lab05/insecureweb.c)].
